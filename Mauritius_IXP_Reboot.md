# Mauritius IXP Reboot

Much like the island country where it is situated, the Mauritius Internet Exchange Point (MIXP) is relatively small. We have ten unique organisations or operators participating, with a total of twelve (13)  peering ASNs. (One ASNs is the MIXP’s management network itself, that provides the web site, statistics and so on).

Being small makes some things easier, but it also has it's challenges. One  challenge has been continuing to build awareness and maintaining excitment.

## Uncovering a (mostly) forgotten IXP

But let's start at the beginning: Many reading this may not know, as I did not until my involvement, that the MIXP has been around in some form since 2005. As best as we can tell, back then a switch was plugged in and powered up in a cabinet, to which two or three operators connected. (There were not very many more operators at the time). Not much else was done, and it remained like this until 2014. A handful of other networks may have plugged in over the intervening years, but there is no accurate record of who was connecged when.

In mid-2014, the AU’s AXIS Project facilitated IXP tutorial sessions for operators, government stakeholders and regulators in Mauritius to discuss the advantages of connecting their networks to an IX. These sessions generated fresh interest among many participants in the local Internet space.

On the back of this interest, several new operators connected to the dust covered switch and interested people started to discuss how best to manage and grow the MXIP.

While not part of the tutorial sessions, I was fortunate to be included in some of these discussions, and in a position to contribute.

## Re-launching the IXP

Part of having a successful exchange point is not only the technical side but also the publicity side. You need to get out and build awareness to bring operators in. 

After much discussion, the voluntary committee, myself included, decided that the best way to build this awareness and implement new strategy was to re-launch MXIP, which is what we did in August 2015.

Between the initial sessions and the officialSince re-launching, we had a total of 9 ve operators connected, and have recently added the 10th. Given the population of Mauritius isn’t expected to grow exponentially in the future, we don’t expect to connect the number of operators larger IXPs have. However, what we do hope to grow is our traffic, which remains relatively modest at an average 20-25 MB – still, a massive improvement from less than 1MB in late 2014. 

For us to achieve growth in this area, we need to address several challenges; the largest requiring the big operators in Mauritius to peer over the network. Hopefully this a matter of when, not if, and will in turn help with attracting new operators keen to acquire the benefits of a truly connected Mauritius.

The Mauritius Internet Exchange Point is open to any network operator that believes that they can make their network more efficient through peering.
